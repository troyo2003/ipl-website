                The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was founded in 2007, with funding provided by Zee Entertainment Enterprises.[10] The ICL was not recognised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the BCCI were
                not pleased with its committee members joining the ICL executive board.[11] To prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize money in their own domestic tournaments and also imposed lifetime bans on players joining
                the ICL, which was considered a rebel league by the board.
